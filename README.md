 Email Spam Detection System using Machine Learning

 Project Overview
The Email Spam Detection System is a machine learning–based application designed to classify emails as **Spam** or **Not Spam (Ham)**. The system uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for text preprocessing and a **Random Forest (RF)** classifier for prediction. A user-friendly **Streamlit web interface** allows real-time email classification.


 Objectives
- To detect spam emails accurately using machine learning
- To apply NLP techniques for text preprocessing
- To visualize important spam and ham keywords using WordClouds
- To deploy an interactive web-based email spam classifier


 Machine Learning Approach
- **Text Preprocessing:** Lowercasing, tokenization, stopword removal, stemming
- **Feature Extraction:** TF-IDF Vectorization
- **Classification Model:** Random Forest (RF)

 Model Performance
- Accuracy: 98.68%
- Precision: 99.28%

The Random Forest model provides high accuracy and precision, making it reliable for real-world spam detection.
